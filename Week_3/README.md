<h1>About the data</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  The data chosen for the visualization is from the official Australian government website. Hence, the accuracy of the data is guaranteed. Meanwhile, there quite some limitation due to some data missing and privacy 
  is close to none since the dataset is available for the public to see and check.<br><br>
  
  The data processing: First of all, the data is cleanse by replacing any missing values with "Unknown" to make sure it is a complete data. Then, it checks for any duplicates row before being checked for 
  first letter capitalization to ensure consistency. Finally, it is being checked for any unnecessary column which would then be removed since it serves no purpose other than clogging up the work.<br><br>

  I declare that the data set I used is retrieved ethically and is being used meaningfully.
