            <p class="text-light fs-4">Australia's television consumption has evolved significantly in recent years, driven by the rise of streaming services and digital platforms. Traditional TV viewing still holds a place, but many 
                Australians now prefer on-demand content through services like Netflix, Stan, and Disney+. <br>
                <br>
                This shift is influencing viewing habits, with audiences increasingly opting for flexibility in when and how 
                they watch. Despite this, live TV, especially for sports and major events, remains popular. The growing trend towards high-definition and 4K viewing, coupled with the rise of smart TVs, is also 
                shaping the future of television consumption in Australia.</p>

                                Along the x axis, the screen sizes are grouped together into intervals, with each bar representing a range of screen sizes.

                                The height of each bar corresponds to the amount of a particular size falling within that range.
                                This is a quick way to see which ranges of screen sizes are the most common here in 
                                Australia. </p>

                                    This scatter plot display the correlation between screen size and power usage. Each dot represents a specific point,
                                    indicating screen size and its power usage. In short, as the screen size increases, the avergae power mode contiunues to
                                    rise as well which suggests that larger screens require more power to run.

                                    Moreover, it is clear that there are more than one dot
                                    stack on top of each other. This is because there are multiple screen sizes that are have the same integer, but differ in decimal point
                                    which is so miniscule that its difference is barely visible in the chart.

                        This is the KNIME data cleaning and processing workflow. The process is divided into 2 parts: the left is the cleaning part and the 
                        right is the processing part which is responsible for the data visualization or charts.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        First Step is reading the CSV file through a CSV reader node. The data is then filtered to remove any rows with missing values, ensuring that the analysis is based on complete data.
                        Further more, the brand name is capitalized to ensure consistency in the data before going through a Column Filter node to remove any column that is unnecessary for the analysis.
                        which in this case is the Grand Date column which is missing every values.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Second step is processing the data to create the charts. This is usually done by using group by node the group the column that is needed for the charts.
                        And most of the time, there is a need for an extra node to calculate the data before it can be presented.
