<h1>GenAI Acknowledgement</h1>

<hr>

<p><b>I have acknowledged the fact that I use GenAI assistance. </b><br>

<fieldset>
    <p>
        function showCurrentPage() {
            const currentPage = window.location.pathname.split('/').pop();
            document.getElementById('currentPage').innerText = `You are currently on: ${currentPage}`;
        }
        window.onload = showCurrentPage;
        //Showing users what page they are on
    </p>
</fieldset>

<br>

<p>Above is a JavaScript code from the main.js file which is responsibile for displaying which page the user is currently on. I have never studied JavaScript before hence I had no idea how to complete this task requirement. With the use of GenAI, I was able to understand the logic and implement the necessary functionality to display the current page. </p>
